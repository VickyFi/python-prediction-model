# python-prediction-model

The scope of this project to create a model that will predict the progression of the disease. 

In the 1_clinical_dataset.csv file this is displayed in the 'RISK_MOLECULAR' column. 
All patients should be divided into 3 categories based on this file: {Good, Intermediate, Poor} and the prediction model should classify patients into these three categories based on the value of the gene expression described in 3_expression_dataset.csv.

In this projrct was implemented:
* Feature selection of the appropriate features that are used as input to the classifier.
* The model with 10 classifiers.
* Model estimation metrics are calculated.

The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
